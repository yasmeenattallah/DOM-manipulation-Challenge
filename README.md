## What is the DOM?

The DOM is the _Document Object Model_, it is the browser's interpretation of the page once it has been parsed.
It's something implemented by web browsers rather than provided by the JavaScript language itself.

## DOM elements

In your browser, if you _right-click_ on a page, you see _inspect element_.
